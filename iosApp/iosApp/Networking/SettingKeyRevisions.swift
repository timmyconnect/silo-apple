//  The manifest revision that introduced each generated key.
//
//  The Swift bindings carry only the newest revision they were generated from,
//  and treating every server older than that as "upgrade required" would turn a
//  binding refresh into an outage for every feature on every older server.
//  Gating per key instead matches the web client
//  (`manifest_revision >= introducedIn`): a revision-8 server keeps serving the
//  keys it has always served, and only features built on newer keys fall back.
//
//  The generator does not emit `introduced_in` for Swift, so this table is
//  hand-maintained. `SettingsConformanceTests` checks it against the vendored
//  manifest, and the exhaustive switch makes a regenerated key a compile error
//  here until its revision is recorded.
